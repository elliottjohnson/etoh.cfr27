etoh.cfr27: A library to interface with US Title 27 Subchapter A

This code is based upon US Code of Federal Regulations 27, Subchapter A
parts 1-39, which concerns regulations governing alcohol.

The current reference is to the January 10th, 2018 version, so as
modification to the code occurs there will be a need to update this
library.  When using this software look to see if the latest
definition is up to date.  This is stored in *cfr27-version-timestamp*

The initial focus of the creation of this library is sections
regarding distilled spirit manufacture.  In the future more
definitions will be added as needed or contributed.

The concept behind this library is to provide the basic declaration of
how alcohol is produced in the US as well as some higher level
utilities, helper functions and classes as an API.

Subchapter A is broken down into the following parts that this library
aims to eventually include:

     	 1 - Basic permit requirements
	 4 - Labeling and Advertising of Wine
	 5 - Labeling and Advertising of Distilled Spirits
	 7 - Labeling and Advertising of Malt Beverages
	 9 - American Viticultural Areas
	 12 - Foreign non-generic names of geographic significance
	 17 - Drawback on taxpaid distilled spirits
	 19 - Distilled Spirits Plants
	 24 - Wine
	 25 - Beer
	 28 - Exportation of Alcohol
	 29 - Stills and miscellaneous regulations
	 30 - Gauging manual
